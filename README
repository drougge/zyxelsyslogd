I have a ZyXEL GS1900-24 switch, which can send various messages to a
syslog server. Regrettably it does not seem to agree with my syslogd (from
NetBSD) on how such messages are to be formatted.

Here's an example message it sends:

"<135> Dec 28 2015 03:36:43 192.168.1.1 %Port-7: Port 18 duplex is set to force Full "

It's pretty clear to a human reader what this is trying to say. It's using
the traditional BSD syslog protocol (RFC 3164, not the new RFC 5424), it's
a local0.debug message sent on Dec 28 2015 03:36:43 from 192.168.1.1 with
the message "%Port-7: Port 18 duplex is set to force Full", plus an extra
space at the end.

But of course that's not what it's really saying if you read the spec. No,
this message contains no date, and it's sent from the host "Dec". The
message is missing the TAG field, and the end result is you get this in
your log file:

"Dec 28 03:36:43 Dec -:  2015 03:36:43 192.168.1.1 %Port-7: Port 18 duplex is set to force Full "

while I had hoped for something more like this:

"Dec 28 03:36:43 192.168.1.1 %Port-7: Port 18 duplex is set to force Full "

which would actually let me match on the host part for selecting which file
it goes to.

All this because there's a space after the PRI part. (And possibly also
because the syslog protocol is not so great.)

Anyway, the end result is that I wanted my own syslogd to log these
messages, and here it is.

Confuration consists of creating directories (or links to directories) for
each host IP you want to log for, and in these directories you get files
named %Y-%m-%d.log. The timestamp in the message is ignored.

You can also optionally pass --host and/or --port to the daemon, to bind to
something other than ('', 514).
